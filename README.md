I did two years of systems engineering, where I acquired the basic knowledge of programming and data architecture.

Then a few years later, I arrived at Henry's bootcamp, where I developed my technical skills with more than 700 hours of code and challenging projects, which expanded my skills, not only technical, but also soft skills.

Today, I am in the fourth year of a computer science degree at Siglo 21 University, where the focus is on the development of new leaders and entrepreneurs, in addition to computer development.
